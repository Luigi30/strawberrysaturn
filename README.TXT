Saturn Demo v0.0 by Charles Doty (cdoty@earthlink.net)

This is my attempt to put together a sample Saturn program. The main purpose
of this program is to provide a template for programming the Saturn.

This program can be compiled with Sega's GCC compiler.

To run this program, use ssfexe (available at
http://saturndev.emuvibes.com). The name (upper box) is
x:\sub-directory\sl.bin. The I/O port (lower left box) is the port of the PC
Comms Link card (330 for me). The starting address (lower right box)
is 06004000.

To use ssfexe, turn off Saturn, start ssfexe, enter information, press top
button, then turn on the Saturn.

Ssfexe is a bit slow, so it will take a while to transfer files.
